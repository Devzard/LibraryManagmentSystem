# Library Management System

For this project we choose to make a Library Management System in C. It uses a user login system to ensure trusted users use the application. It stores data in “csv” format so that it remains useful for other purposes. Backup facility is being added for users to back up their data properly. The system has been made totally modular. The entire project can be used for other data management purposes really easily with some tweaks.

  

## Functionality

  

- Inserting data in the file

- Deleting data in the file

- Displaying all the data in the file

- Creating backup of the data in the file
